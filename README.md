To run the demo and see how our model performances, follow step:
1. Download the trained model from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1GNsQ7J75ltqwihA1OtRsHJE5T9Yoxv42?usp=sharing); save directory 'Inference' to the root directory of the project.
2. Run notebook file: **Inference.ipynb**
3. To see how the model performs on different input images, you can repeatedly run the second cell.

To see how the training works, or even retrain the network, follow steps:
1. Open notbook file: **Training_Rerun_Demo.ipynb**
2. You can see the source code of training, as well as train from scratch by running this notebook.
